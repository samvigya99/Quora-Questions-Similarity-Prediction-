# Quora-Questions-Similarity-Prediction

While searching through google, we all have come across Quora in search of our answers. Quora is a open source platform where people post their doubts and thoughts. Mostly people post their questions and others answer or show their thought on it.

Several users post questions on Quora to get answers and different perspectives from people all around the world. Due to this, one type of question is usually posted many times in different languages and sentences. This leads to excessive use of resources for Quora and chaos for its users. They cannot find an exact and crisp answer for their questions and it leads to wastage of time.

This project's objective is to identify the pair of questions which contain two questions with the same meaning using NLP. If the questions which are similar are pooled together along with their answers, the users will get a clear answer for their questions. We are using a dataset provided by Quora. We have two set of questions in each row and we have to classify that are these question duplicate or not.

We used NLP and ML to predict the duplicate question.
